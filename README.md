# PyTorch Diabetes Classifier

This repository contains code for building a diabetes classifier using PyTorch. It includes data loading, model definition, training, and evaluation.

## Overview

The code loads a diabetes dataset, preprocesses the data, defines a neural network model, trains the model, and evaluates its performance. It also demonstrates techniques like dropout regularization and experimenting with different optimizers.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different configurations for building your own diabetes classifier.
